## Sadaiv CI

Backup your opensource contributions on to the decentralize network.

### About the project

Sadaiv CI allows developers to integrate continuous integration (CI) that automatically backsup their project repo on to the decentralized Filecoin Storage.

### Backstory 
ÌŒ
Today, most of the developer communities and organizations (including DAOs) uses GitHub to host their projects. GitHub is a centralized organization providing a limited support for web3 native values and hence the data could be lost.

To resolve, this issue there are tons of other projects built on web3 stack that provides a alternative UI and architecture to host projects. But guess what people still don't use them.

Because the features, and comfort GitHub (or web2 solutions) provides is uncomparable to the new immature emerging solutions. 

Hence, we thought to create a continuous integration to store the projects on GitHub to decentralized network like Filecoin using Web3.Storage. This basically backsup the project on to the decentralized network every time a new commit is pushed to the branch. 

Therefore, with Sadaiv CI developers can work with the comfort of web2 solutions like GitHub yet ensured about the ownership of their project and contributions.
